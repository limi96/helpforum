    When you mark a question as solved, you will be asked to first mark the answer that best
    helped you with your question.

    <br>
    <br>
    After this, your question thread will effectively be <b>closed</b>.

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>The following changes will be applied:</b>

    <blockquote>-The title of your question will be marked with the tag "[SOLVED]". </blockquote> 
    <blockquote>-You will no longer be able to edit the title of your question or its description! </blockquote>
    <blockquote>-Users will no longer be able to post new answers or edit their previous answers!</blockquote>
    
    The answer that you chose to be the best answer will be marked with a green tag
    and will always be displayed first.
